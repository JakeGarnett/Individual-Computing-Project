# Comparative Analysis of Algorithms for Optimal UAV Routing

This is the code repository for the Individual Computing Project KV6002.

UAV Route Optimization is calculated by the collective sum of all visited interest points/prize collection location and routing problem (PCLRP).

Solutions are evaluated by the collective sum of visited interest points and collected penalties: repeated node visits and UAVs running out of charge.
